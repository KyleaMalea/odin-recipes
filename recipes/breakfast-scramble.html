    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>8 ounces breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 small russet potato, diced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup small-cubed Cheddar</li>
            <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, bacon and onion and saute until the meat is cooked through and the onion is golden, about 8 minutes. Drain off the fat. Add the potato, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook to warm the potato, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together the half-and-half, eggs and some salt and pepper in a pitcher or bowl until combined.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Lower the heat under the skillet to medium low. Pour in the egg mixture and cook until soft, creamy curds begin to form, a few minutes. Add the cheese and green onions and cook, stirring, until the eggs are cooked and the cheese is almost totally melted, a few minutes more.</li>
